# Fake-News-Predictor
In this project I have used textual News data and analyzed it, further I have fitted a Logistic Regression model ( since this is a binary classification problem ) on this dataset to classify News Articles as Real ones or Fake Ones

I have got my dataset for this project from the Kaggle API (Dataset File Link) : https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news/data?select=train.csv
